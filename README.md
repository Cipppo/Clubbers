# Clubbers

### Main Goal
*Clubbers* is a social network created for people who enjoy clubbing all over the world.
We stand between clubs and guests by offering various services.

We first delineate 2 types of accounts:
- Club accounts.
- Users accounts.

The difference between these two accounts is that the club account is meant to share pure advertisment content in order to show to how is the life in that precise club, while the user account is meant to share every type of content took in the night before.

Club accounts are able to create events in which normal users can join and have a chat with the other users joined, there will be also a feature where you can ask/offer a car lift.
